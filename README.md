# Verilog

Verilog is another widely used hardware description language that allows designers to model electronic systems. Developed in the 1980s, it is known for its simpler syntax compared to VHDL, making it more accessible for many designers. 

This repository contains my practical experiences with Verilog Hardware description language
that contains the implementation of different combinational and sequential logical circuits.
